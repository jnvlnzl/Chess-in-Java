 * This class represents the ChessBoard. Its job is to keep track of where all
 * of the pieces are. Since we just learned about two-dimensional arrays, it 
 * might be a good idea to use one here (just a hint). Currently, it doesn't do 
 * anything, but it does have four methods for you to fill in. These are the only
 * required methods in this class. As long as these work, feel free to do whatever
 * else you want to get this class working.
